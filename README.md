# Predicting 5-Year Survival Among Colorectal Cancer Patients

Clinical predictive modeling system analyzing 866,740 patient records from the SEER Colorectal Cancer database to predict 5-year survival outcomes.

## üìä Project Overview

This capstone project processes and analyzes a large clinical dataset to build high-performance predictive models for colorectal cancer patient survival. The models achieve ~80% accuracy and ~79% recall while optimizing thresholds to prioritize recall and minimize false negatives in a critical clinical context.

## üéØ Key Results

- **Dataset Size**: 866,740 patient records (SEER Colorectal Cancer database)
- **Model Accuracy**: ~80% (CatBoost and LightGBM)
- **Model Recall**: ~79% (optimized for clinical context)
- **Focus**: Minimizing false negatives to avoid missing at-risk patients
- **Deliverable**: Comprehensive HTML report for clinical review and research

## üîë Key Survival Predictors Identified

1. **Cancer Stage** at diagnosis
2. **Age** at diagnosis
3. **Surgery Status**
4. Additional clinical and demographic factors

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **CatBoost**: Gradient boosting for tabular data
- **LightGBM**: High-performance gradient boosting framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn**: Model evaluation and metrics
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **HTML Reporting**: Deliverable generation
